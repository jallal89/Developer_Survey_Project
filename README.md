# Python Project: Developer Survey 2019
Developer Survey is an annual survey by Stack Overflow, it is the largest and most comprehensive survey of people who code around the world.
The dataset covers developersâ€™ favorite technologies, their job preferences and more. 
This project has 3 different files: 
 + **developers_survey_2019_code: This file has all the code, python libraries used, visualizations and RDBMS SQL queries. All of this is done in Visual Studio Code Jupyter Notebook**
 + **developers_survey_2019_dashboards: I used  IBM Cognos Analytics to build 3 different dashboards for the project** 
 + **developers_survey_2019_presentation: After everything was done, I made a presentation of the project analysis, the findings, the implications and the suggestions based on dataset respondents preferences**
 
## Languages Used: 
 + **Python**
 + **Few queries in SQL**

## Tools Used:
+ **Visual Studio Code - Jupyter Notebooks**
+ **IBM Cognos Analytics for dashboards**
+ **Microsoft PowerPoint for presentation**

## Project Key Findings and Analysis:
- Languages such as Python, C# and SQL will continue to grow as demand is high
- Among all programming languages, Scala and R are the least desired for the developers for the current year
- A key reason as why some of these languages are more desirable is due to platforms where the language is used
- MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server remain among favorite DBs among developers and this trend is likely to continue
- MongoDB keeps its place among favorite DBs and comes in 3rd place among favorite DBs for coders
- Relational DBs like SSMS appear to be widely used as tabular, structured data is crucial
- Big technology will need both, relational and non-relationshal DBs and dashboards analysis tells us exactly that
- Data evaluations and dashboards tell us how crucial education is on coding developers
- Coders appear to be more men compared to women, reducing gaps in tech is crucial for society overall
- Gaps in tech also show among countries, where developing nations appear to need more skills and help
- Online learning, internet and platforms such as YouTube can provide opportunities for developing societies
- Technology changes in fast pace and nations will need softwares updated, skills improved to catch up
